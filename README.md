1. THE WISE-WOMANS ſaving the City Abel, by delivering the head of SHEBA,2 Sam. 20 16, &c. who was a Traytor to the Kingdome of Iſrael. Which ſerveth as a patterne, whereby the city of London may be ſaved, by the wiſe endeavours of the Citizens thereof, like this Wiſe-womans, (who is upon divine record, both for our learning and imitation) even by delivering up to Law and Juſtice, the Traitors to the Common-wealth of England. Otherwiſe if they (under the colour of defending themſelves, Parliament or City) do any longer ſhelter ſuch wicked men, (as vipers in their boſomes) or take up armes againſt our renowned Army, or any others, having their Commiſſion, for ſuch a juſt, reaſonable, and lawfull demand, will they not manifeſt to the whole world, that they themſelves are not onely Traitors alſo to the Common-wealth, both in partaking with the wicked, and condemning the juſt, but are guilty of whatſoever blood-ſhed, ruine, or deſolation, may poſſibly come upon them and their poſterity?

1. The Maladie, conſiſting in the Parliaments injuſtice of all ſorts, ſelfe-intereſtes and grinding the faces of the poore, ſuch as their illegall ſentences, unjuſt impriſonments, burning (by the common-hangman) the juſt Petitions of all the Commons Liberties, &c.

1. An Appendix containing divers worthy particulars belonging to the premiſes, which doe moſt conſiſt in Objections and Anſwers.

1. Needfull Queres to the Parliament.

1. A faithfull Advice to the Armie.

1. A Premonition to all Commons and Souldidiers, fore-warning them, that if they will ſet God before their eyes in all their practiſes, bee as true henceforth as they have been heretofore, to their owne native Countrey and Priviledges, and proceed valiantly as they have begun, he will ſo aſsiſt them, in crowning all their labours and toiles with victory, as glory may redound to him, and comfort to them and us, with all the poſterity.
